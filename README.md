# Another txt editor

I decided to create a plain text editor to test my skills with tkinter.  
Currently is very limited, but it works for create, open and save files.

_Note: I only tested it on Windows._

**TODO:**
* Add more functionalities
* <del>Add user custom options</del>
* <del>Split the large code in smaller files</del>
* Add Spanish language support
